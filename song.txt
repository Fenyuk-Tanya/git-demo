I just found your necklace
In the space between my bed
But I wish that I hadn't
Don’t want you to take it back (yeah)
‘Cause you know that I feel so lonely without you here by my side
It's just been so hard to remember not to call you mine
Anymore

‘Cause my heart just feels so empty
And I'm having trouble connecting
Everything you said when you left me all alone

Yeah
So I’ll tell you I'm fine
But I'm just terrified of wasting your time
So I'll rewrite the melodies
And I'll take back the memories of you

Now I'm lying awake here
And I'm trying not to cry
'Cause when I look outside my window I see your name written in the sky

⦑ Pre-Chorus: Days to Waste ⦒
‘Cause my heart just feels so empty
While I’m having trouble connecting
Everything you said when you left me all alone
